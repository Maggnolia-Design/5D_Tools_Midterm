            <h2>SASE Conference Committee</h1>
            <h3>Advertising Committee  |  2015-2016</h3>
         </div>
         <p>For four months, I participated in the Advertising and Website Committee of Northeastern's Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers. I collaborated with the committee head to design the poster for their 2016 Regional Conference. On my own, I also created the tote bag design, name badge design, and a program of events.</p>

         <div class="project-series">
            <div class="project-series-img1"></div>
            <div class="project-series-text">
               <ul>
                  <li>Conference Poster</li>
                  <li>Dec 2015 - Feb 2016</li>
                  <li>Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Through text and visuals, the conference poster shows off the theme of the conference "Collaborate, Create, Inspire: We Are The Solution." The outstretched hands and blank jigsaw puzzles act as a metaphor for the conference; they encourage the conference attendees to join us in working on something fun together. The lines and circles above the text are a branding element that I created for the conference. I kept the typeface and color schemes simple to eliminate clutter.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="project-series">
            <div class="project-series-img2"></div>
            <div class="project-series-text">
               <ul>
                  <li>Tote Bag</li>
                  <li>Feb 2016</li>
                  <li>Illustrator</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The tote bag design is fairly simple. In previous drafts, I tried to incorporate the branding elements (namely, the circle and line motif) and other important text (such as the date, university name, and conference slogan). Ultimately, we wanted to take away everything except the minimum necessary for someone to recognize the event: the SASE logo, and the conference title and year. I used the same typeface as the poster.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="project-series">
            <div class="project-series-img3"></div>
            <div class="project-series-text">
               <ul>
                  <li>Name Badge</li>
                  <li>Feb 2016</li>
                  <li>InDesign</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Similar to the tote bag, the name badges could only show so much information without being overcrowded. In previous drafts I wanted to take away the starkness of the white background, so I made a wall of science and engineering buzzwords with low opacity behind the main text. When this became too cluttered, I opted for just a very faint conference title and slogan in the background. The SASE logo and conference logo frame the badge-holder's name, university, and major.</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Program of Events</li>

                  <li>InDesign</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The Program of Events is a 16-page program that I design on a tight deadline; I was given only about half a week before the conference date. Inside, I created a color-coded table of contents, along with a full schedule, workshop descriptions, keynote speaker descriptions, and more. I was careful to use consistent spacing and typographic choices throughout the program.</p>
